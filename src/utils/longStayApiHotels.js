 * lastMinuteApiHotels.js, which this reuses rather than copies). Rooms and
 * booking go through the normal supplier pages (/api-room-list,
 * /api-booking-page-hotels), not the long-stay ones, so the contract pricing and
 * /api/longStayBooking/create are not involved.
 *
 * Gated by hbs.long-stay.api-hotels.enabled. While it is off, or the check fails,
 * the page behaves exactly as it did before this feature.
