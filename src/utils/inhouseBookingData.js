 * In-house (apiId 1) `sessionStorage.bookingData` builders.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from RoomList.jsx (handleBooking / handleProceedBooking)
 * so the merged multi-supplier room list (ExternalApiRoomList.jsx) can send
 * an INHOUSE rate of a mapped hotel to the in-house booking page in exactly
 * the shape HotelBookingPage already reads. Key order and values are kept
 * identical to the original inline code, so RoomList's stored bookingData is
 * byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * HotelBookingPage relies on:
 *   - selectedRate.hotelId  → the LOCAL numeric hotel id (policies, terms,
 *                              max-cancellation-nights, create payload)
 *   - payload.apiId         → 1 (forwarded to /api/hotel-booking/create)
 *   - payload.{agentId, checkInDate, checkOutDate, rooms, nationality, …}
 *   - hotelStaticData.{hotelName, address, starRating}
 *   - roomBreakdown[]       → per-room category / meal plan / rate (multi-room)
