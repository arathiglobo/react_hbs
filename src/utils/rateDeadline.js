/**
 * Free-cancellation deadline shown on every room-list rate card.
 *
 * One helper for every supplier and for inhouse, because the three pills this
 * replaces (Atharva / Darina / GoGlobal) had drifted apart — different date
 * formats, different wording, and the Atharva one wasn't even red.
 *
 * Where the date comes from, in order:
 *   1. `rate.deadlineDate` — the supplier's own field. Only Atharva
 *      ("DD-MMM-YYYY"), Darina ("yyyy-MM-dd") and GoGlobal ("dd/MMM/yyyy")
 *      populate it; see RateOptionResponse.java.
 *   2. the earliest `cancellationPolicies[].fromDate` — the first charge band
 *      starts when free cancellation ends, so that date IS the cut-off. This
 *      is the only source for Jumeirah, IWTX, X3, RateHawk and inhouse, and
 *      it is where the backend already writes RateHawk's
 *      `free_cancellation_before` (RatehawkHotelRoomSearchService.java).
 *
 * Every date resolved here is pulled one day earlier than the supplier's own
 * cut-off — see SUPPLIER_DEADLINE_BUFFER_DAYS — so a cancellation is actioned
 * with a day in hand. INHOUSE has the same treatment under
 * INHOUSE_DEADLINE_BUFFER_DAYS, and GRN under GRN_DEADLINE_BUFFER_DAYS in
 * components/grn/GrnPolicy.jsx, where it also keeps its own colour-coded,
 * IST-based pill rather than routing through this file.
