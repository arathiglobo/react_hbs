// Centralized feature flags for optional/experimental UI features. Flip a
// flag to false to disable that feature app-wide without touching the
// components that consume it.

// Controls the "Explore on Map" hotel-location preview (HotelSearch.jsx +
// components/map/MapModal). When false, the trigger button is hidden and
// no map code runs.

// Defaults for backend-driven feature flags. Used before the boot fetch of
// /api/config/features resolves, and as the fallback when that endpoint is
// missing (old backends that don't ship the config controller). Keep every
// entry defaulted to the "safe / old" behavior so a missing endpoint never
// exposes an unfinished feature.
//
//   rateCalendarEnabled — new backend ships RateCalendarController and the
//   /api/hotel-search/rate-calendar family of endpoints. When true the
//   date fields render the fare-hint <RateCalendar>; when false they
//   render the pre-existing plain <Form.Control type="date">.
//
//   packageCardViaGateway — backend package.payment.card-via-gateway. When
//   true, picking "Card" on a package booking always pays through the
//   payment gateway (checkout and Reconfirm). When false, "Card" behaves as
//   before: settled from the agent's credit limit when it is enough.
//
//   packageAdminConfirmation — backend package.admin-confirmation.enabled.
//   When true, a paid package booking waits for an admin, who books its
//   hotel with a supplier from the detail view's Selected Services (and the
//   booking list gets an "Awaiting confirmation" type for admins).
