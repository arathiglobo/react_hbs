// Supplier / DMC ("partner") feature catalog — the frontend half of the
// backend's PartnerFeatureCatalog.java. Both are keyed by the same codes,
// which are the New Booking menu codes (nb_hotel, nb_package, …).
//
// One entry per feature says what an approved feature unlocks on this side:
//   • newBooking   – the New Booking flow entry (sidebar + dashboard tile)
//   • registration – the registration / inventory page(s) behind it
//   • bookingList  – its Booking List page
//   • routes       – URL patterns the partner route guard lets through when
//                    the feature is approved ("*" = one path segment; a
//                    pattern also matches anything nested below it)
//
// Hotel-family features (24 Hour, Last Minute, …) have no registration page
// of their own: their setup lives as a tile on the per-hotel Hotel Actions
// hub, so `hotelHub: true` additionally unlocks the hotel list + hub routes.
//
// Three consumers read this file and must never disagree:
//   components/PartnerSidebar.jsx, pages/PartnerDashboard.jsx and the partner
//   branch of components/PrivateRoute.jsx. Labels here are fallbacks — the
//   label stored in partner_feature (returned by /api/partner/me and
//   /api/partner-features) wins when present.
//
// To add a feature: add its entry here + the matching FeatureDef on the
// backend. Nothing else needs to change.
